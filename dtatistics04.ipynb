    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a specific value will occur. It maps each possible value of the random variable to its probability. For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF would assign a probability of 1/6 to each possible outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF, on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables and gives the relative likelihood of the variable taking on a specific value. Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to specific values, the PDF assigns probabilities to ranges of values. The area under the PDF curve within a specific range represents the probability of the variable falling within that range. For example, in the case of a standard normal distribution, the PDF represents the bell-shaped curve that describes the probabilities of different values occurring.\n"
